Vehicle license plate capturing and identifying system.<br><br>
I'm trying to devlope a system which will capture the vehicle license plate image based on motion detect and the captured image will be give to an OCR system to identfy the the License plate number.<br><br>
This project is C# based.<br><br>
Anyone want to contrubute are always welcome and your comments will help me to devlope it.
